# ROADMAP

This quick and dirty document just list the roadmap tasks.

## Docker compose

- upgrade the version of postgresql?

## Dependencies

- replace poetry by UV?

## Entities

### Music

- should we add a relationship between the track with the (top) artist?

## Renaming project

- replace spotifagent occurrences almost everywhere...

## Logging

- Review to improve it! We have almost nothing!

## Sync

- review it for a top level batch handling (to release memory yb saving in DB before) + atomicity?
- spotify: import the extended streaming history?

## Recommendations / Suggestions

- spotify: search endpoint to discover new musics?
- found other providers for recommendations (listenbrainz or musicbrainz)?
    => last.fm: works pretty great with latino sounds, but only :/ hip-hop/rap FR not supported at all
    => tastedive API

## Playlist (recommendations)

- spotify: create a user playlist

## AI agents

Once the project is stable, try to auto-generate the agents scripts
